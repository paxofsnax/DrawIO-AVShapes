# DrawIO-AVShapes

Custom AudioVideo XML shape code for Draw.io's Insert Shapes attribute editor.

## Overview

[Draw.io] has a large library of pre-built shapes and allows users to embed their own raster and SVG images into diagrams. While this adds flexibility, it limits styling options for raster and SVG images. These formats are not native shapes, so they lack metadata for styling elements like shadows and line widths.

## Custom AV Shapes

This repository contains XML code for creating custom AV shapes in Draw.io.
